# A list is a COLLECTION!
# Creating a list variable -> good_name = [ ]
# create an empty list to hold ages
ages = []
# create a list of names
names = ['dave', 'jorge', 'juliet']
# add an age to the age list and a name to the name list

''' 
remember that for loops are good at going through collections
for item in collection:
    do something each time we get an item
''' 
# use a for loop to go through the lists and print each item


''' 
we can access each item in the list through an index
lists are stored in memory in adjacent memory buckets

# print just the second item in each list


# use a for loop to go through the ages list and
# add all the ages together for a total of all ages
