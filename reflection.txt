Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
This semester I saw the power of functions in the program we made where we made a picture using different draw to screen functions.
I reused the same functions over and over again in the program to draw different things to the screen functions
which is way more efficient than not having functions and copy pasting code.



2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
The value of test functions is to make sure that changes in your program do not break anything. Each time you change
a function or edit you code you test functions should still pass.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
My process for toubleshooting and fixing a program that has a problem is to first review any code I have recently changed.
I also periodically run my program to make sure certain functions I am making are working properly. If I cannot
find the error in my code just by reading it and reviewing the logic, then I run the debugger and closely follow
the flow of the program and watch the variable values. To improve this process, I could get to know the debugger
better or write out psuedo code to plan out the logic of the program beforehand.
